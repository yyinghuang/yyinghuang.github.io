I’m a PhD candidate at [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/)(BICMR) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Professor [Zhiqiang Li](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/lizq/).
I got my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/index.html) in 2020.

Here is my [CV](.../assets/CV_Yinying Huang.pdf).

Research interests: Dynamical Systems, Ergodic Theory, Ergodic optimization, Continued fraction.
